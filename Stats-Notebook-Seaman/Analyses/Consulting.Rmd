# From the 'Class Activity - Idea Approval for the Week 11 "Consulting Opportunity or Research Project"' I've complied the following ordered lists for clarify and reference. 

# However, I believe I've already found my analysis idea and client.

# 	2.	Assessed weather’s effect on chicken egg-laying rates and recommended climate-control improvements (for a family chicken farm).
